	<ExecutiveSummary>As more people in all sectors of society come online, it is important to consider how we might help these groups work together in meaningful ways. My research focuses on the design and management of online communities that bring together diverse stakeholders, particularly underrepresented populations (kids, elders, minorities, etc.), and support them in leveraging their strengths in a collaborative environment. My thesis work, Palaver Tree Online, is an example of one such community.</ExecutiveSummary>
